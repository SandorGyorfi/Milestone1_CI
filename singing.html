                        Olivia's musical talent was noticed by her parents at the age of 5. In 2016, she was invited to take part in the children's got talent show 'Little Giants' on RTL channel, where children could showcase their talents from different angles. Olivia's outstanding vocal performances made her the individual winner of her category.
                        Subsequently, in 2017-2018, as an invited performer for the 'Kővirágok' singing school, she performed Disney fairy tales songs (Pocahontas: Colours of the Wind; The Princess and the Frog: Almost There) at several of the school's flagship anniversary events.
