                    series Señores Papis.
                    The series mixes comedy and drama to tell the story of the twists and turns of four friendly fathers
                    and their family. Olivia's father in the series is Miki, who is constantly torn between his ex-wife,
                    who is raising their two daughters, and his new wife, who is expecting their youngest heir. As he
                    tries to live up to his old family and his new one, it increasingly seems that neither is
                    succeeding. In this role, Olivia plays a shrewd, cunning little girl who tries to reunite her
                    divorced parents through various tricks. She played the role for three seasons (2019-2021),
                    appearing in 199 episodes. His character has received very positive professional and audience
                    feedback.</p>
